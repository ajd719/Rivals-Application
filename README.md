# Rivals-Application
Inspired by the current lack of sporting applications, the author has created ‘Rivals’, a gamified app that allows users to connect and play sport with other members of the community. It matches participants through skill level and points scored on the application. It creates authentic connections between users through their love of sport, something which, other apps have failed to incorporate. 

The application can be found here: https://unibrightonac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/a_donnachie1_uni_brighton_ac_uk/EUABRjDtMU9Lirkj26pNj2EBnBSzlP6Xs2nHjYdOX0o2dA?e=ZxEzpw
